Problem Statement 1:
There are a number of servers running our application.
Given N servers, in 5 minutes interval, every minute, the load is checked and if load is
less than 50%, the servers are either reduced to N/2 else they are increased to
2N + 1
Input : No. of servers (N), server load every minute
Output : The number of servers running at the end of 5 minutes

Example:
Input:
2 (2 servers)
10 60 50 15 20 (On 1st minute - 10% load, on 2nd minute - 60% load & so on)

Output:
1 (After 5 minute, 1 server is running)




Problem Statement 2:
Everyday, the restaurant has a limited number of breads, vadas and samosas. The
restaurant needs to optimise orders in a way that they can generate maximum profit.
Vadapav needs two bread and a vada
Samosapav needs two bread and a samosa
Input:
First input is: no. of breads, no. of vadas and no. of samosas available in the
restaurant
Second input is: Price of Vadapav & price of Samosapav set by the restaurant
Output:
Maximum profit possible

Example:
Input:
9 2 3 (9 breads, 2 vada, 3 samosa)
10 15 (Rs.10 - Vadapav, Rs.15 - Samosapav)

Output:
55 (Maximum profit possible is Rs.55)
